FullStackOpen2020
This is my project to learn web development through FullStackOpen. I'm extremely passionate about learning web development not only because it's freaking awesome ,but, also so that I can hopefully start a career in web development. This is going to be using JS, React, Redux, etc. I'm hoping that I can put up 30 hours a week into this program and hopefully can finish around March of 2021.
